This version still handles all cases in scantst.pas except the last two. 

Even though in the first assignment we only were required to intake numbers up to +- 38, my program would still produce the correct results for -40.

I would say my other program is more robust. It handled all the cases that this one did and it returned errors for the ones it couldn't. This one returns no errors.



using 

"make lexer"

./lexer < graph1.pas
